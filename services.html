            <h4 class="text-white">ABOUT MANOHA TAX</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">Ten years ago Antonio Casseus, Manoha tax Service CEO, came with the idea to support taxpayers who were struggling in filling income their tax returns. Since then, Manoha Tax Services has become a family to those taxpayers. We’ve been helping people with different type of issues in their income tax returns. Our goal is to provide the feeling of a personal tax consultant alongside the security, assurance, and protection that a large company can provide. Working with advanced technology to make sure that your tax return is done accurately, our staff is well trained and able to face any challenge.
</p>
              <p class="text-muted">Every year, we continue to train our employees to implement all IRS requirements. For instance, certain tax return preparers are required to take and pass a competency test. The purpose of this test is to identify those candidates that meet the minimum competency to prepare 1040 series returns. We have been in business for eight years; however, our staff has over ten years of experience. One of the things that make Manoha Tax Services unique is how supportive we are to our customers and our high quality service. Manoha Tax Services is based in Jacksonville, FL and continues to expand, offering personal service and more in an ever growing list of locations in Jacksonville, FL. Knowledge drives every Manoha Tax Services consultant, and its experience that has made us able to have such remarkable growth in a short period of time.</p>
